# Healthy-Lifestyle-in-Python
This project aims at helping you lead a healthy lifestyle.
As soon as you start this program, a clocks starts ticking, which is scheduled to go on for 8 hours.
In every 28 minutes, this program will play an audio what reminds you to drink water. Suppose each glass has 200 mL of water, one glass every 28 minutes for 8 hours will approximately help you drink 3.5 L.
In every 30 minutes, this program will play an audio to remind you to do some eye exercises to relax your eyes.
In every 45 minutes, this program will play an audio to remind you to indulge yourself in some physical exercise.
The time required to drink water, eye and physical exercise is not counted in the schedule.
To stop the audio, you need to type in a certain keyword, provided on the screen to move ahead with your schedule.
After every successful activity, a log is updated, maintaining your records.
